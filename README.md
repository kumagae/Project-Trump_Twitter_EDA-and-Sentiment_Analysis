# Trump-Twitter-EDA-and-Sentiment-Analysis
Trump's Twitter EDA and Sentiment Analysis using the Twitter API, Pandas, Matplotlib, VADER, etc. 


This project uses Twitter's API in order to analyze the 45th President's tweets.

The first phase of this project uses pandas to import/clean data and make some insights into what device the data comes from and what time Trump's tweets arrive at.

The second phase uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner). VADER lexicon is used to analyze the sentiment of the tweets. It is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically for common social media language. This allows assignment of a numerical polarity value to individual words and emoji (see VADER section of notebook). In other words, this allows the project to measure the polarization of Trump's tweets.

The analysis of this project can be used for any type of text sentiment analysis. Possible applications may be for measuring a youtube channel's comment polarization or for a product review sentiment analysis.

NOTE: This is meant to be a fun project, meant to showcase data and not make a political statement.
